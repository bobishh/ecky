## Sketch to Solid: Plate from a Profile

Most useful CAD starts as a 2D outline. In Ecky IR, a sketch/profile becomes a solid with `extrude`.

```scheme
(model
  (part plate
    (extrude
      (rounded-rect 70 42 5)
      4)))
```

`rounded-rect` is the closed 2D profile. `extrude` gives it thickness.

Use `profile` when the shape has holes.

```scheme
(model
  (part washer_plate
    (extrude
      (profile
        :outer (rounded-rect 70 42 5)
        :holes (circle 9 64))
      4)))
```

The outer profile defines material. The hole profile removes material during the extrusion.

This is the core move: draw a closed 2D region, then give it height.

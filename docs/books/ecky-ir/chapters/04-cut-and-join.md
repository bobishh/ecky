## Cut and Join: Mounting Plate

Use `build` when a part needs named intermediate geometry.

```scheme
(model
  (params
    (number plate_w 80)
    (number plate_h 48)
    (number thickness 5)
    (number hole_r 4))
  (part mount
    (build
      (shape blank
        (extrude (rounded-rect plate_w plate_h 4) thickness))
      (shape hole_left
        (translate -24 0 -0.5
          (cylinder hole_r (+ thickness 1))))
      (shape hole_right
        (translate 24 0 -0.5
          (cylinder hole_r (+ thickness 1))))
      (result
        (difference blank hole_left hole_right)))))
```

`build` names each step. `difference` subtracts cutters from the blank. The cutters are slightly taller than the plate so the cut passes fully through.

Add material with `union` or `fuse`.

```scheme
(result
  (union
    (difference blank hole_left hole_right)
    (translate 0 0 thickness
      (cylinder 12 8))))
```

The result is still one part, but the intent stays readable.
